Is seldom the case that a good tale has a true starting point, but since the effort of analyzing the neverending flow of events that cause its origin entails a considerable task, I have to select one of them only based on my poor memory.

Let's go back to April 2007 where as a 18 years teenager, and ignoring the signals of my environment, I was convinced to study Psychology, but was finally discouraged to do so by my Phylosophy teacher whose respect for Physics had a contagious influence over me that remains until today. 

September 2011, 22 years. What a great summer that had been. Once I broke free from the pressure of the final exams, I had only wanted to run away from physics. A task in which I meritoriously succeed, mostly under the sun and sometimes by side the moon. _"Physics is nice, but not convincingly nice."_ I would have proudly said by that time. However, driven by the necessity of making myself a more desirable working tool I decided to enroll in a postgraduate of Quantum Technology and Quantum Information.

April 2012, still 22. _"I could be a great Farmer, I love living outside, in contact with Nature, and I don't love almost failing Quantum Field Theory for a second time."_ My Facebook friends found this quite funny, while I was only worried about my future.

July 2012, 23. Somehow I ended up applying for a PhD grant, and opposite feelings fought inside me. _"I have to try at least, this might well be the last chance before leaving the academic path forever. Besides, in the unlikely situation that I am awarded the grant, the period for the first renewal is only 6 months, I can always quit afterwards."_ I was telling my good friend, and also physics adept, Xabi. Excited and scared, as you can see.

July 2014, 25. The next day I was supposed to give an informal talk in the group of NASA Ames in California USA. All the admiration ("_NASA ... wow!_") I got from people outside the scientific atmosphere found a cold answer, because by that time I knew I was not good enough to be there. The PhD had only been a continuation of my errant trajectory always avoiding to engage. The responsability of that important talk had a tremendous effect on me, I could not and I would not disappoint Kike and Lucas, my supervisor and closest coworker. I deeply believe that the emotional experience of that day forced me to bring out my best. Not only I enjoy it, but I regarded my effort as the right attitute towards my work. And since that day, the passion for physics, that had always been there unattended, is cultivated with dedication.

March 2017, 27. Four months after the ceremony, already as Dr. Alvarez-Rodriguez, I had secured a first transition postdoc in QUTIS to finish my project in Quantum Biomimetics, but other than that, I was not very sure about my next step. I found no reason for leaving my beautiful region, the core of my happiness and home of all the ones I love. Even if I wanted to grow scientifically, the price seemed too high.
